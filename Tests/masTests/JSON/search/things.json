        "description": "Get things done! The award-winning Things app helps you plan your day, manage your projects, and make real progress toward your goals.\n\nBest of all, it’s easy to use. Within the hour, you’ll have everything off your mind and neatly organized—from routine tasks to your biggest life goals—and you can start focusing on what matters today.\n\n“Things offers the best combination of design and functionality of any app we tested, with nearly all the features of other power user applications and a delightful interface that never gets in the way of your work.”\n—Wirecutter, The New York Times\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Your To-Dos\nYour basic building block is the almighty To-Do—each a small step toward a great accomplishment. You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features. Here are just a few:\n\n• Reminders — set a time and Things will remind you.\n• Repeaters — automatically repeat to-dos on a schedule you set.\n• This Evening — a special place for your evening plans.\n• Calendar integration — see your events and to-dos together.\n• Tags — categorize your to-dos and quickly filter lists.\n• Quick Entry — create to-dos from anywhere, as soon as the thought hits you.\n• Quick Find — instantly locate to-dos, headings, or tags.\n• Type Travel — jump from list to list with your keyboard; just start typing!\n• Mail to Things — forward an email to Things; now it’s a to-do.\n• And much more!\n\n\nMADE FOR MAC\n\nThings is tailored to the Mac with deep system integrations as well. A great example is Quick Entry with Autofill: a shortcut that grabs content from other apps and adds it to Things for you, such as a link to a website or an email you want to get back to.\n\nYou can also enjoy a beautiful dark mode at sunset, connect your calendars, enable a Things widget, use your Mac’s Touch Bar, import from Reminders—Things can do it all! There’s even AppleScript support if you need powerful automation.\n\n\nSTAY PRODUCTIVE ON THE GO\n\nThings has full-featured apps for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch as well (sold separately). All your devices sync seamlessly via our free Things Cloud service. It’s great to have everything at your fingertips when you need it!\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed, not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there. Install the app today and see what you can do!\n\nVisit our website now and get a free 15-day trial for your Mac: thingsapp.com\n\nIf you have any questions, please get in touch. We provide professional support and will be glad to help you!",

        "description": "Better is a privacy tool for Safari that protects you from trackers and privacy-eroding ads on the web.\n\nMake your web experience safer, lighter, and faster in Safari on Mac. \n\nHow is Better different?\n• Blocks tracking scripts, tracking pixels, and behavioural advertising.\n• Uses our unique, hand-curated, and open tracker database based on our own web crawls. Browse the encyclopaedia-like tracker entries on our web site if you fancy learning more. \n• We identify and block the most prevalent trackers. This makes Better’s block list lightweight and effective.\n• We base our blocking decisions on the principles of the Ethical Design Manifesto (https://ind.ie/ethical-design). \n• Developed and curated by Ind.ie – that’s Laura and Aral – a tiny two-person-and-one-husky not-for-profit striving for social justice in the digital age.\n• Open, transparent, and free as in freedom.\n\nOther features:\n• Improves the readability of popular web sites. \n• Spotlights the worst offenders… Did you know that the worst site we found on the web had 172 trackers? Better blocks them all and makes that site 4× lighter and 15.8× faster!\n• Blocks blocker blockers (try saying that quickly a few times!) Whenever we can, we try to protect you from sites that try to put you at risk by forcing you to turn off your privacy tools.\n• Your personal Do Not Block list enables you to turn Better off for sites that don’t play well with Better. Easily contact us about those sites so we can fix the experience for everyone.\n\n5 star App Store reviews from around the world:\n• “Best blocker I've tried yet: Clear and straight forward business model plus actually works. Feel safe blocking trackers and knowing the developers won't sell you out. Can't beat that.” (USA)\n• “This app does everything it promises to do and sets a new gold standard in content blockers.” (Belgium)\n• “This piece of software is just THE most essential thing to stay sane on today’s world wide web.” (Germany)\n• “Thanks for such an incredibly simple app to make the web just that bit better!” (UK)\n• “I love better, I use it on my phone and I’m very happy to see it on the Mac!” (Germany)\n• “Does exactly what it advertises, constantly updated, and I really support the mission of this company.” (USA)\n• “Fantastic blocker with a rational, ethical approach to privacy and monetization in this digital age.” (USA)\n• “Honest privacy: Thanks for defending the public against surveillance capitalism!” (USA)\n• “Buying this not only benefits you, it actively supports the ethos of internet privacy.” (USA)\n• “Fantastic: The best adblocker I have tried.” (USA)\n• “Best Adblocker out there: Unobtrusive. Works fast & reliable” (Germany)\n• “It just works!” (Germany)\n• “A fantastic approach to ad blocking & preservation of user privacy” (Australia)\n• “Thanks to these two brave people who made this app. It gives me at least some peace of mind about the nasty surveillance practises of the big tech companies.” (Netherlands)\n• “Better web: Fixes so many sites without you even noticing it.” (Finland)\n• “Best ad & tracking blocker-type app I've used on the appstore!” (Norway)\n• “Great app: Does exactly as described, works it’s magic in the background whilst I’m browsing the web.” (Sweden)\n• “Speed and privacy: Easy to install and does exactly what it’s supposed to: frees your browsing of megabytes of privacy-invading tracking. Even if you don’t mind unknown third parties building up and selling profiles of your browsing behaviour (and everything that can be inferred form it), the speed increases of both download and rendering by removing those trackers really surprised me. It’s simply made browsing the web far quicker and is worth the money for that alone.” (UK)\n• “It's good to see such nice people stand up to tracking and malvertising. This app does everything it promises to do and sets a new gold standard in content blockers. Spend a few bucks to take back the web from disrespectful business models. You won't regret it.” (Belgium)",

With NotePlan for the Mac and iOS, you can manage your calendar, notes, and tasks in one place.  Instead of constantly context switching, you can stay focused and accomplish what you set your mind to.\n\nWe recommend starting by getting everything out of your head and captured in one place - such as a “Planning” note. After gathering your thoughts, NotePlan allows you to seamlessly translate items into tasks.  Set dates to these tasks, such as “tomorrow” or a specific day of the week. \n\nBy integrating with Apple’s Calendar and Reminders, NotePlan can show you your meetings and events next to the tasks you set. Weekly or Monthly calendar view gives you a quick snapshot of what is scheduled, and where you may have gaps in your day so you can quickly schedule additional things to accomplish.  \n \nReviewing and managing open tasks and deadlines is incredibly easy. On top of that, notes are perfect for brainstorming, saving links, taking meeting notes, or storing reference materials. NotePlan is highly-customizable too with handsome light and dark themes as well as tagging for organizing and wiki-style linking between notes.\n\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or problems, please contact us.

        "description": "BusyCal 3 is the most powerful, flexible, reliable calendar app for macOS. It's packed with innovative, time-saving features including customizable views, calendar sets, integrated to dos, travel time, smart filters, natural language input, weather, moons, graphics, tags, do not disturb mode and much more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE VIEWS\n\nBusyCal displays your calendar in Day, Week, Month, Year and List views. What makes BusyCal unique is its ability to customize these views to more precisely meet your needs.  You can choose the number of weeks shown per month, or days shown per week, and you can even customize the calendar's appearance by choosing a font face and size, calendar colors, time format and more.\n\nINTEGRATED TO DOS\n\nIn BusyCal, To Dos are integrated into your calendar, display on the date or time they are due, and carry forward until completed. You can also display a To Do List in the sidebar. NOTE: Reminders in iOS 13 / macOS 10.15 is not compatible with BusyCal.\n\nINFO PANEL\n\nBusyCal's info panel enables you to quickly view and edit event details with speed and precision. The info panel can be displayed in the sidebar, as a popup or a floating window. And it's completely customizable, you can choose from a wide range of attributes to display including time zones, tags, maps, private notes, last edit time and more.\n\nNATURAL LANGUAGE INPUT\n\nBusyCal enables you to create events and to dos using natural language. A preview of the event details are displayed while you type as it recognizes titles, dates and times, locations and more. You can even use it to add contacts or attendees to an event, set alarms, add URLs, and to indicate the calendar to create the event on.\n\nTRAVEL TIME\n\nBusyCal allows you to block out time for walking, driving or taking mass transit to an event or location. You can set a fixed amount of travel time or determine it automatically using the integrated support for Location Services and Apple Maps. You can even receive alerts when it's time to leave as traffic conditions change.\n\nMENU BAR APP\n\nThe BusyCal menu bar app is always running, even when the main BusyCal app is not running, so you always have access to your schedule. \n\nSMART FILTERS\n\nBusyCal's Smart Filters are a powerful tool for managing your calendar. Smart Filters can be accessed with a keyboard shortcut or a button on the toolbar to display calendar sets (showing/hiding multiple calendars), perform saved searches (events that contain 'Joe'), apply view settings (an 8-week month view) and much more.\n\nALARMS\n\nBusyCal displays alarms in a movable, resizable floating window that offers the ability to snooze an alarm for any number of minutes from now or before the start of an event, or snooze multiple alarms at once. And BusyCal Alarms trigger even when the main BusyCal app isn't running, so you'll never miss an important appointment.\n\nWEATHER & MOONS\n\nBusyCal displays a live 10-day weather forecast, phases of the moon, and sunrise and sunset times. \n\nGRAPHICS\n\nBusyCal lets you add graphics to your calendar to highlight holidays and special events. You can choose from the built-in Emoji and IconFinder images, or drag images from your desktop or web.\n\nBUSYCONTACTS INTEGRATION\n\nBusyCal integrates with its sister app, BusyContacts, forming a flexible easy-to-use CRM solution. By adding contacts to events in BusyCal, you have instant access to a contact's email address and phone number, as well as a record in BusyContacts of your interactions with them.\n\nSYNC AND SHARE CALENDARS\n\nBusyCal supports iCloud, Reminders, Google, Exchange, Office 365, CalDAV, LAN sharing as well as WebDAV subscriptions, enabling you to sync calendars with other Macs and iOS devices running BusyCal or the built-in Calendar app. This includes the ability to share calendars, schedule meetings, and view the availability of others.",

        "description": "This is the original version of Midnight Inbox that brings Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity to the desktop in true delicious style, now updated for the latest versions of Mac OS X with native support for 10.6 and 10.7! And now available for free!\n\nWe have new versions of Inbox for the iPhone and iPad for you to check out, and are working on a whole new desktop version of Midnight Inbox. See what's new with Inbox on our website: http://www.midnightbeep.com\n\nThe workflow.\nTop to bottom, Inbox provides an automated workflow of simple input, intuitive organizing, and contextual outputs. Just jump right to the part that best fits your situation: from collecting your thoughts, to concentrating on your work.\n\nAutomatic zero.\nGetting to the bottom of your inbox is what this app is all about. As things pile up you need to get them sorted and acted upon; Inbox makes this quick and easy by giving you shortcuts to the places where things need to be, and the assistance to get them done.\n\nGTD complete.\nMidnight Inbox is inspired by the Getting Things Done methodologies created by David Allen.

        "description": "BusyContacts is a contact manager for macOS that makes creating, finding, and managing contacts faster and more efficient.\n\nBusyContacts brings to contact management the same power, flexibility, and sharing capabilities that BusyCal users have enjoyed with their calendars. What's more, BusyContacts integrates seamlessly with BusyCal forming a flexible, easy to use CRM solution that works the way you do.\n\nBusyContacts syncs with the built-in Contacts app on macOS and iOS and supports all leading cloud services, including iCloud, Google, Exchange, Facebook & Twitter.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE VIEWS\n\nContacts can be displayed in two views: A single column list view, or a multi-column table view that allows you to control the columns displayed (e.g. company, last name, first name, email, phone, etc.) and the sort order.\n\nTAGS\n\nTags are an extremely flexible way to manage contacts in BusyContacts. You can assign multiple tags to each contact and a tag cloud allows you to easily filter the list of contacts by tag (e.g. family, client, prospect, coworker, etc.).\n\nACTIVITY LIST\n\nThe Activity List shows a chronological listing of activities associated with the selected contact including meetings, to dos and other calendar events (requires BusyCal), communication through email and messaging, and social network posts. Note: Email communication is only available on macOS 10.14 and below.\n\nBUSYCAL INTEGRATION\n\nBusyContacts integrates with BusyCal allowing you to link contacts to events and to dos in your calendar, providing flexible CRM capabilities for scheduling meetings, follow up tasks, and tracking past activities.\n\nSOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION\n\nBusyContacts syncs with leading social networks including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, allowing you to integrate photos, birthdays and other information from social networks with your contacts.\n\nSMART FILTERS\n\nSmart Filters are a powerful tool for filtering contacts and creating saved searches that can be applied with a single click. You can create Smart Filters to display contacts that match certain conditions, such as a text string, tag, or birthdate. Or you can create Smart Filters to remember view settings such as columns displayed and sort order.\n\nSYNC\n\nBusyContacts syncs with all leading cloud services including iCloud, Google, Exchange, and other CardDAV servers, and syncs with the built-in Contacts app on macOS and iOS.\n\nSHARE\n\nBusyContacts allows you to share address books with other BusyContacts users with read-only or read/write privileges.

Support for valid markdown as well as custom markdown makes it easier to create your best work.\n\nAllegory also includes a brilliant hand-crafted drawing area which lets you select from a variety of colors, long-holding on any of the tools brings them into focus with sliders to adjust their opacity and stroke size with gorgeous animations that strike awe.\n\nYou can bookmark and set due dates on any note from anywhere in the app regardless of where you are, which makes performing essential actions entirely seamless, further reducing friction for users. Seamless iCloud sync adds upon the notion of keeping your notes exactly where they need to be. Notes can be searched for within the app in ways that make sense to you, by words and dates, or by using language that comes naturally such as ‘today’, ‘yesterday’, and ‘last week’. A summary of your current note also provides further context on your writing by displaying character/word/line/paragraph counts, sentiment analysis to portray how positive or negative your writing is, quick links to open the specific note, and more.\n\nInspiration can strike anywhere, and that is why Allegory supports custom action extensions that allow creating notes and putting down ideas from other apps. You can also use Siri to do the same. Scan documents and text to convert it to notes, or add images within notes to provide more context. When you want to share your work with the world, use one of the many export options to create files that work best for you, from TXT and MD, to HTML and PDF. Or simply export as an image or plain text. It's built in ways that make sense to your workflow.\n\nTweak and adjust the app to make it look and behave the way that you want. From app icons and tints, to markdown settings and haptics, there's a settings option to make the app your own. URL schemes and Siri shortcuts allow you to perform useful actions in Allegory from anywhere. Allegory is available on your iPhone, your iPad, and your Apple Watch, and supports seamless iCloud sync to share notes without lifting a finger.\n\nAll the power of iOS is in your hands with Allegory. It is fully integrated with the latest technologies such as Dark Mode, a standalone Apple Watch app, Siri, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Context Menus, iCloud sync, Notifications, document scanning, biometric locks, custom haptics, Pencil support, keyboard shortcuts, URL schemes, custom app icons, iMessage stickers, fully accessible, and more.\n\n—\n\nGET IN TOUCH:\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please get in touch. Allegory was created by an incredibly small team of one and I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm available through email shihab@allegoryapp.info or Twitter @AllegoryApp or @JPEGuin.\n\nhttps://www.allegoryapp.info/terms\nhttps://www.allegoryapp.info/privacy",

        "description": "Powerful, flexible and simple task management that is a pleasure to use, The Hit List can handle personal tasks and professional projects. Use it with The Hit List for iPhone v2.3 (available on the iOS App Store) which includes The Hit List for Apple Watch and enjoy fast, reliable sync service included with the purchase of the app.\n\nIt is as easy to use as making lists.\n\nNeutralize chaos, and recapture your time and focus. Your life is complicated enough as it is. The tool to manage your life shouldn't be. The Hit List keeps things simple by not forcing you to learn a system. It can be as simple as just keeping a list of things to do as you would on a piece of paper. However, if you do use a task management system such as Getting Things Done by David Allen, The Hit List is flexible enough to support you.\n\nCapture and forget what you need to do later with The Hit List and get your \"now\" back, with confidence.\n\nThe Hit List includes sync service to sync with The Hit List for iPhone and The Hit List for Apple Watch (sold separately on the iOS App Store) or other Macs.",

        "description": "SwitchGlass adds a dedicated application switcher to your Mac. You can customize its appearance, size, and position on each attached display, including hiding it on selected displays. Use it to bring one or all of an app’s windows to the front, or as a drag-and-drop target to open files.\n\nThe following app switcher attributes can be customized individually for each attached display:\n\n• Visibility - Permanently hide, show, or auto-hide the app switcher. Auto-hide keeps the app switcher hidden until the mouse cursor touches the region of the screen edge where the app switcher is positioned.\n• Position - Move the app switcher to one of eight different positions on each screen.\n• Orientation - Make the app switcher horizontal or vertical in a given position.\n• Material - Change the appearance of the app switcher background to one of four possible choices (see screenshot above) including a mode where it automatically matches the system appearance (e.g, dark when dark mode is active, light otherwise).\n• Corner Style and Radius - Choose from three corner styles: square, circle, or “squircle” (a “continuous” rounded corner style). The corner radius can also be adjusted.\n• Icon Size - Adjust the size of app icons in the switcher from 16 to 256 points.\n• Icon Padding - Adjust the padding between icons from 0% to 100% of the configured icon size.\n• Margin - Adjust the amount of space around the app switcher.\n\nAdditionally, the following global settings may be customized:\n\n• App Sort Order - Sort apps by name or launch order, descending or ascending.\n• App Filtering - Show all apps or just those with windows on the current display.\n• Menu Bar Icon - Choose from three possible menu bar icons.\n• App Exclusions - Select apps that should never appear in the app switcher.\n\nHere’s how the app switcher works in its default configuration:\n\n• Click an app icon to bring all windows from that app to the front.\n• Hold down the Shift key while clicking an app icon to bring just one window from that app to the front.\n• Hold down the Option key while clicking an app icon to hide the current app before bringing the clicked app to the front. (Option-clicking the currently active app will hide it.)\n• Hold down the Option and Shift keys while clicking an app icon to hide the current app before bringing just one window from the clicked app to the front. (Option-Shift-clicking the currently active app will hide it.)\n• Right-click (or Control-click) an app icon to activate a context menu from which you can perform any of the supported actions (described below).\n• Drag one or more files or folders onto an app icon to open those items with the app.\n• Hold down the Command key while clicking on an app icon to reveal the app in the Finder.\n\nThe click and Shift-click actions are configurable. Each may be set to any one of these actions:\n\n• Show All Windows - Activate an app and bring all its window to the front.\n• Activate - Activate an app and bring a single window to the front.\n• Reopen - Activate an app in a way that triggers its “reopen” handler. Apps can choose to do whatever they want in response to a “reopen” action, but most bring a single window to the front, opening a new window (or un-minimizing a window from the Dock) if none are open.\n• Reopen and Show All - This is the same as “Reopen” except that SwitchGlass will also bring all the app’s windows to the front after sending the “reopen” action.\n\nFor more information, click the SwitchGlass menu bar icon and choose “Help”, or visit https://hypercritical.co/switchglass/#help",

If you are not happy with what you are producing you can try to increase your productivity by using our FocusTimer, a tool that will allow you to maintain concentration and carry out more tasks simultaneously.\neasyPlanner aims to make your life easier and “to work” in place of your memory. Getting organized means having more free time for you and for those you love, dedicating the time you have saved to create unforgettable moments with the people of your life.\n\nMANAGE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO AND THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER\u2028\n\nWe provide you tasks, projects and memos management in a single app.\n\nTASKS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to do” through our “Tasks”. Each task can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks) and can be grouped into folders. \n\nPROJECTS\n\nWhen a certain number of tasks are closely related to each other and they concern significant commitments, it is possible to manage them as a single project. Even the project, like the task, can contain infinite sub-tasks (multi-tasks).\n\nMEMOS\n\neasyPlanner allows you to manage the “things you need to remember” both in free format and in a structured format using memos.\n\nMONITOR YOUR REPETITIVE TASKS WITH REPORT\u2028\n\nThe \"Report\" function was born of the need to represent a set of complex data or complex tasks in the form of a table so that they can be printed and read more easily. Thanks to this function you will be able to graphically visualize a set of recurring tasks in a simple way and you will be able to monitor the progress of these tasks daily.\n\n\nINCREASE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY WITH FOCUS TIMER\n\nFocus Timer has been designed after a careful study based on several time management theories. It is a very advanced “time management” system which consists in dividing time into intervals, each of which is characterized by a task that you have to do. This division leads the subjects who use it to be much more efficient, to better manage their time and to constantly develop their mental abilities.\n\nAGENDA\n\u2028Thanks to the Agenda view easyPlanner will allow you to keep track of your schedule and your appointments at any time.\nAgenda will also integrate the Apple calendar. \nYou can add your events in the calendars directly from here in a practical and fast way.\nYou can decide which calendars to see and which to hide.\n\nICLOUD SYNC\n\nWith easyPlanner you can archive your photos, your documents, your tasks, etc. on ICloud and you can synchronize all your devices automatically and simultaneously.
